# Psychological Sentiment Analyzer – Psychological Sentiment Analysis with NLP 💖

## 🌟 Project Overview

In our digital world, prioritizing mental well-being is critical. This project, stands as a testament to our commitment to fostering a more empathetic and supportive online environment.

This project applies advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify mental health-related text into **seven distinct sentiment categories** — `Anxiety`, `Bipolar`, `Depression`, `Normal`, `Personality Disorder`, `Stress`, and `Suicidal` — using both traditional machine learning and fine-tuned transformer models (RoBERTa). It demonstrates how AI can assist in early detection of mental health issues from user-generated content.
Our goal is to provide a tool that can help in early detection and understanding, paving the way for timely support and intervention, and reminding us that behind every screen, there's a human story.

> Behind every message is a human story — and these tools can help make those voices heard.

## 🧠 Motivation

In the digital era, individuals often express their deepest struggles through online platforms. Sentiment analysis offers a way to detect and interpret these emotional cues, providing:

- 🆘 **Early intervention** for at-risk individuals  
- 🌐 **Public mental health insights** to shape policies  
- ❤️ **Stigma reduction** through empathetic AI  
- 🧠 **Tailored support systems** via classification-driven responses

## 🔧 Methodology

### ✅ Data Preprocessing

A robust preprocessing pipeline cleaned and normalized text data, including:

* **Text Cleaning**: Expanding contractions, replacing special tokens (URLs, mentions, hashtags), expanding acronyms, handling digits, reducing repeated characters, and removing punctuation.
* **Linguistic Processing**: Removing stopwords and lemmatizing words (using spaCy/NLTK).
* **Filtering**: Removing short texts (less than 5 words after cleaning).
* **Label Distribution**: Analysis of sentiment class distribution (Depression: 33.77%, Suicidal: 23.20%, Normal: 20.78%, etc.).

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Comprehensive EDA was performed to understand sentiment distribution and textual patterns. Visualizations generated include:

* **Sentiment Distribution Charts**: Bar and Pie charts.
* **Word Clouds**: Per sentiment class.
* **N-gram Plots**: Unigrams, Bigrams, and Trigrams per sentiment.

### 🧪 Models Implemented

This project utilized both traditional machine learning and advanced deep learning models:

1.  **Logistic Regression (Baseline Model)**
    * **Vectorization**: TF-IDF with `max_features=5000` and `ngram_range=(1, 2)`.
    * **Hyperparameter Tuning**: `GridSearchCV` with `f1_weighted` scoring across various solvers, penalties, and C values.

2.  **RoBERTa (Transformer Fine-Tuned)**
    * **Model**: Fine-tuned `roberta-base` for sequence classification.
    * **Configuration**: Used `RobertaTokenizerFast`, custom `dropout rate: 0.2`, and `weight decay: 0.01`.
    * **Training**: Employed `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` with balanced class weights, `AdamW` optimizer, and `linear warmup scheduler`. Trained for 7 epochs with validation monitoring and early stopping, achieving a **best validation accuracy of 0.7386**.

## ✨ Prediction Result Example

The model can lovingly process raw text and output the predicted sentiment along with the probability distribution across all defined sentiment classes, offering insights that can guide compassionate responses.

**Example 1: Positive Sentiment**
* **Original Text:** "I am feeling absolutely ecstatic and overjoyed today, everything is wonderful!"
* **Cleaned Text:** "feel absolutely ecstatic overjoyed today everything wonderful"
* **Predicted Sentiment:** Normal
* **Class Probabilities:**
    * Anxiety: 0.0111,
    * Bipolar: 0.0693,
    * Depression: 0.1111,
    * **Normal: 0.7580**,
    * Personality disorder: 0.0073,
    * Stress: 0.0021,
    * Suicidal: 0.0412

**Example 2: Depression Sentiment**
* **Original Text:** "The weight of this sadness is crushing me. I feel so empty and depressed."
* **Cleaned Text:** "weight sadness crush feel empty depressed"
* **Predicted Sentiment:** Depression
* **Class Probabilities:**
    * Anxiety: 0.0011,
    *  Bipolar: 0.0012,
    *  **Depression: 0.9742**,
    *  Normal: 0.0023,
    *  Personality disorder: 0.0015,
    *  Stress: 0.0006,
    *  Suicidal: 0.0191
